Hello! I'm an assistant professor at the [Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/). A biostatistician by training, I develop statistical and machine learning methods to solve applied problems in healthcare. My [research interests](research.qmd) focus on the use of observational real-world data to improve clinical research, healthcare delivery, and population health.

I completed my PhD in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.washington.edu/)  at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), where I worked with [Ali Shojaie](http://faculty.washington.edu/ashojaie/index.html) on causal inference and machine learning methods for analyzing network-structured data. After my PhD, I worked as a senior data scientist at [Flatiron Health](https://flatiron.com/), where I built data products from electronic medical records in support of oncology research and clinical care.

I am based in New York City, and am always excited to talk about collaboration opportunities. Please reach out if we have shared interests!
