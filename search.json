    "text": "I’m interested in using observational real-world data (RWD) from e.g., electronic medical records, insurance claims, and government registries to improve healthcare.\n\nHow can RWD help design clinical trials?\nReal-world data can be used to improve the design of randomized clinical trials by learning about the demographics, treatment patterns, and disease natural history of the target population. Moreover, RWD can facilitate covariate adjustment to improve the precision of treatment effect estimates, by helping discover prognostic variables for the trial outcome.\n\n\nHow can RWD be used to improve clinical care?\nPredictive machine learning models can be trained on RWD to surface patients at elevated risk of adverse events (such as unexpected ICU visits), which can then be used to triage care resources. A more complex problem is applying causal machine learning for personalized clinical decisions, by learning casual effects for individual patients. Relatedly, combining clinical trial data with RWD allows learning the heterogeneity of treatment effects among different subpopulations.\n\n\nHow can RWD be used to learn about population health?\nObservational studies are conducted to learn a variety of population parameters, such as comparative effectiveness of drugs that haven’t been compared in clinical trials, generalizability of treatment effects, or access to care among subgroups. Analysis of RWD enables the answers to these questions, among others. However, RWD is subject to many data and statistical issues, including selection bias, missing data, and measurement error. Therefore, there is a need for analytic methods that can account for these, and answer research questions unbiasedly."

    "text": "Hello! I’m an assistant professor at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research. A biostatistician by training, I develop statistical and machine learning methods to solve applied problems in healthcare. My research interests focus on the use of observational real-world data to improve clinical research, healthcare delivery, and population health.\nI completed my PhD in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington, where I worked with Ali Shojaie on causal inference and machine learning methods for analyzing network-structured data. After my PhD, I worked as a senior data scientist at Flatiron Health, where I built data products from electronic medical records in support of oncology research and clinical care.\nI am based in New York City, and am always excited to talk about collaboration opportunities. Please reach out if we have shared interests!"
