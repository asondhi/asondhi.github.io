Hello! I'm currently a quantitiative scientist at [Flatiron Health](https://flatiron.com/) in New York, where I work on statistical methods for EHR data to support oncology research.

I completed my PhD in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.washington.edu/)  at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), where I worked with [Ali Shojaie](http://faculty.washington.edu/ashojaie/index.html) on causal inference and machine learning methods for analyzing network-structured data. Before starting my PhD, I graduated with a BMath from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). I am proudly Canadian, and was born and raised in Mississauga, a suburb of Toronto, ON. 

In my spare time, I like to read fiction, watch extreme amounts of TV, listen to podcasts, and avoid the outdoors as much as possible (sometimes I'll go running). When time and money allow, I also love to travel, and spend an unhealthy amount of time searching for cheap flights and churning for credit card rewards.
